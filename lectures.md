## What is isomer
[Understanding isomer](https://chem.libretexts.org/Courses/University_of_Kentucky/CHE_103%3A_Chemistry_for_Allied_Health_(Soult)/05%3A_Properties_of_Compounds/5.01%3A_Isomers)
One of the interesting aspects of organic chemistry is that it is three-dimensional. A molecule can have a shape in space that may contribute to its properties. Molecules can differ in the way the atoms are arranged - the same combination of atoms can be assembled in more than one way. These compounds are known as isomers. Isomers are molecules with the same molecular formulas, but different arrangements of atoms. There are several different types of isomers which will be described and a flowchart (see figure below) can help you determine which type of isomers are present.
