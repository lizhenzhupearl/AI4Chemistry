## Introduction
This is a learning materials repo for university students who are interested in developing their skills in adopting artificial intelligence (AI) techniques in their chemistry research. 
Here, students can learn how to deal with molecular systems with various machine learning strategies. This is the core folder for the jupyterbook, which you can go to by clicking [here](https://lizhenzhupearl.github.io/AI4Chemistry/intro.html). 

## Demo task: predicting energies of C7O2H10 isomers
The data given was in isomers.txt and energies.txt; the other files are used for teaching and will be explained during the lecture.
